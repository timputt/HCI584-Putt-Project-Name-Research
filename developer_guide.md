# Developer's guide overview
This project was created to explore how to work with large datasets using Python and several of the data analysis libraries. The social security name records provided a sizeable amount of interesting data.

# Code walk-through
Each section of code is explained in detail via inline comments. 

# Known issues
Python is throwing some errors that don't appear to be impacting the output. However, there is the occasional warning that may at first glance be concerning.

# Future work
With this semester's limited time frame, in combination with my limited experience, there are quite a few questions left unanswered.
